    <h1>Historical Index Returns</h1>

      <p>Investment decisions should be based on as much relevant historical data as possible.  A few researchers have compiled rich, long-running time series of returns for important asset classes.  These time series can have different starting points, usually because of underlying data availability.  Some investment practitioners have sought to increase the statistical validity of their data inputs by creating synthetic time series.</p>

    <h3>Actual and synthetic time series</h3>

      <p>One innovator in this regard is Index Fund Advisors (IFA), which has compiled nearly 90 years of returns for two asset classes (stocks and bonds), and a variety of categories within those asset classes, shown here:</p>

      <ul>
              <li>IFA U.S. Large Company Index</li>
              <li>IFA U.S. Large Cap Value Index</li>
              <li>IFA U.S. Small Cap Index</li>
              <li>IFA U.S. Small Cap Value Index</li>
              <li>IFA Global Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Index</li>
              <li>IFA International Value Index</li>

              <li>IFA International Small Cap Value Index</li>
              <li>IFA Emerging Markets Index</li>
